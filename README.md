- This website offers users the opportunity to delve into the realm of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), specifically focusing on Sorting and Searching Techniques. With a user-friendly interface, the website provides a convenient study platform for individuals seeking to enhance their knowledge in these areas.

- One notable feature of the website is its versatile theme options, allowing users to effortlessly switch between Dark and Light modes. This feature not only enhances the visual experience but also provides optimal readability and ease of use.

- To facilitate easy navigation, a side tab is incorporated into the layout. This side tab acts as a convenient drawer, neatly presenting a comprehensive list of available courses for users to explore. By organizing the courses in this manner, I aim to simplify the user journey and ensure a smooth browsing experience.

- In summary, this project aims to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website that caters to individuals interested in studying DSA, with a specific focus on Sorting and Searching Techniques. The incorporation of Dark and Light modes, along with the intuitive side tab and course list drawer, contributes to the overall usability and aesthetic appeal of the platform.
